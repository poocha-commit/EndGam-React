# Assembly: Endgame

Yo! So this is a fun little word-guessing game I made where you gotta save the programming world from... Assembly  
It's kind of like Hangman but with a cooler twist.

## How it works

- You get a random programming-related word.
- You have 8 guesses to get it right.
- Every wrong guess knocks out a programming language (rip Python, Java, etc.).
- If you run out of guesses, Assembly takes over
- Oh, and there's a timer too — gotta be fast, no chill.

## Features

- Type your guesses by clicking letters.
- Wrong guesses trigger a farewell message in a different programming language (I had fun with this).
- If you guess the word correctly, confetti rains down.
- Lose? Well... you’ll have to go learn Assembly.

## New Game

When you're done (either win or lose), just hit that New Game button and play again.

## Built with

- React
- CSS (for all the colors and styles)
- A tiny confetti package for that celebratory vibe

## Why I made this

Just wanted to make something fun while learning React, state handling, timers, effects, etc.  
Also… anything to avoid actual Assembly, lol.

## Play it, break it, remix it

Feel free to fork it, change the words, or turn it into a JavaScript boss fight. Up to you.

Have fun and may the bugs be ever in your favor
