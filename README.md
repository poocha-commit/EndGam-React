# 🧠 Assembly: Endgame

So this is a fun little word-guessing game I made where you gotta save the programming world from... **Assembly** 😭  
It's kind of like Hangman but with a cooler twist.

## 🎮 How it works

- You get a random programming-related word.
- You have **8 guesses** to get it right.
- Every wrong guess knocks out a programming language (rip Python, Java, etc.).
- If you run out of guesses, Assembly takes over 💀
- Oh, and there's a **timer** too — gotta be fast, no chill!

## 🕹️ Features

- Type your guesses by clicking letters.
- Wrong guesses trigger a farewell message in a different programming language (I had fun with this 😆).
- If you guess the word correctly, **confetti rains down 🎉**
- Lose? Well... you’ll have to go learn Assembly 😅

## 🔁 New Game

When you're done (either win or lose), just hit that **New Game** button and play again!

## 📦 Built with

- React 🧪
- CSS (for all the colors and styles)
- A tiny confetti package for that celebratory vibe 🎊

## 🤖 Why I made this

Just wanted to make something fun while learning React, state handling, timers, effects, etc.  
Also… anything to avoid actual Assembly, lol.

## ✨ Play it, break it, remix it

Feel free to fork it, change the words, or turn it into a JavaScript boss fight. Up to you!

Have fun and may the bugs be ever in your favor 🐛🚫
